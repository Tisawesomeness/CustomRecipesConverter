### CustomRecipesConverter
This tool will attempt to convert recipes made before CustomRecipes 2.0.0 into valid recipes.
To edit the generated recipes, you can use NBTExplorer or [this online editor](https://irath96.github.io/webNBT/).

### How to Use
1. Download the jar [here](https://github.com/Tisawesomeness/CustomRecipesConverter/releases/download/0.0.2/CustomRecipesConverter.jar).
2. Place it in the CustomRecipes plugin folder. Besides the jar, there should be the `disabled_recipes` and `extra_recipes` folders.
3. Run the jar with your favorite terminal using `java -jar CustomRecipesConverter.jar`. Any recipes already converted by this tool will be overwritten.
4. Check the recipes in-game to see if they work.
5. If there are any bugs, DM my [Spigot account](https://www.spigotmc.org/members/tis_awesomeness.83409/) with the original and generated recipes in question.

### Compiling
Simply run `mvn package`.
